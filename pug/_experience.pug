                    | Additionally, I designed an app-based service, emphasizing scalability, user experience, and accessibility, set for future release.
                  p
                    | In parallel, I continued building my personal brand, enhancing my online presence through my website and blog, and developing automation
                    | tools for video editing workflows and music library management to optimize time-consuming processes.
                  p
                    | At the same time, I kept refining my System Design skills through hands-on practice with Event-Driven Architecture and Microservices,
                    | working with tools like Docker and Kubernetes and applying scalable architectural patterns to ensure efficiency and adaptability
                    | in modern software solutions.

                    | on social networks. Then I exposed the collected data via a REST API. Additionally, I developed a Web App for consuming,
                    | querying, filtering, and sorting the collected data. I also acquired the domain name eyvot.com.
